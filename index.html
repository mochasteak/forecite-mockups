<p>We are currently looking for feedback on ForeCite from authors, reviewers and editors of scientific publications. We would really appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to just play around with the interface that we have created and, when you feel you 'get it', please take a short survey to let us know what you think.</p>
<p>The whole exercise should not take more than 10-15 minutes of your time and would really help us understand if we should quit our day jobs and spend our life savings building ForeCite, or stick to working for the man.</p>
