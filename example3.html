                    Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs; aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, mirex, toxaphene, hexachlorobenzene (HCB)) constitute ten of the twelve chemical substances/groups currently defined under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). <span id="#CR1" class="citation">While bans and phase-outs of these chemicals occurred during the 1970s and 1980s in most developed countries, they were not in place in many developing countries.</span> Article 7 of the Stockholm Convention requires National Implementation Plans (NIPs) to be developed by signatory countries. For countries where PCBs and OCPs are still in use or loosely regulated, the NIPs will eventually lead to the phase-out of OCPs for agricultural use and reduced use for disease vector control. However, many countries will be faced with the legacy of past use of these persistent chemicals. Residues in soils, sediments and biota will pose a risk for wildlife and human consumers. The problems of destroying existing stockpiles, especially of OCPs and PCBs in electrical equipment, as well as preventing migration of contaminants from storage areas, will need to be solved. There is a need to monitor levels and trends now and into the future in order to assess compliance with the POPs Convention within each country as well as on a regional and global basis.

                    This review will also mainly focus on methodology for the analysis of PCB/OCPs in biological samples (fish, aquatic and terrestrial mammals and birds) as well as soils, sediment and passive samplers such as semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs). These matrices and environmental compartments have higher concentrations of PCBs and most OCPs than water or air, making them more suitable for routine monitoring and more relevant in the context of exposure of humans and wildlife. Milk and blood are important matrices for POPs monitoring in humans and, in the case of blood, are increasingly used in programs involving live-captured marine mammals and birds. Thus analytical methods for milk and blood are briefly considered here. <span id="#CR2" class="citation">The advantages and disadvantages of various bioindicator species are discussed in detail.</span>

                    PCBs (except non-ortho-substituted congeners; <span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">no</span>-PCB) and OCPs can be considered together because they are extracted and analyzed together in most cases, as discussed below. In practice, most laboratories determine about 30 or more individual PCB congeners, and 10–20 individual OCPs and their metabolites, regardless of the sample matrix. Ongoing POPs monitoring programs vary in their analyte lists. For example, <span id="#CR3" class="citation">the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN) in the Great Lakes region of North America includes over 100 PCB congeners </span>, while the<span id="#CR4" class="citation"> UNEP/World Bank/GEF project on Persistent Organic Pollutants, Food Security, and Indigenous Peoples in Arctic Russia included 15 PCB congeners</span>. The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program recommended 30 ortho-substituted PCBs.

                    <span id="#CR6" class="citation">The UNEP Global POPs monitoring workshop categorized individual PCB/OCPs as “essential” and “recommended,”</span> taking into consideration the need for various levels of analytical capacity building in developing countries in order to conduct the monitoring. For PCBs, a minimum of seven PCBs (28/31, 52, 101/90, 118, 138, 153 and 180) were regarded as essential for routine monitoring of fish and food products around the world. Using only seven congeners severely underestimates total PCB concentrations in some matrices—particularly in abiotic samples such as air, soil, and sediment. On the other hand, <span id="#CR7" class="citation">these seven are robustly determined, having been the subject of numerous interlab comparisons (e.g., QUASIMEME) </span>. UNEP recommended a suite of 30 ortho-substituted congeners for more comprehensive monitoring.

                    Toxaphene and chlordane are multicomponent mixtures and analytical standards are available for some, but not all, major components, which makes them the most difficult to analyze among the eight OCPs on the POPs list. Current programs in Europe are determining three toxaphene congeners, Parlar (P) 26, 50 and 62, and <span id="#CR8" class="citation"> interlaboratory comparisons have shown reasonable agreement for these congeners among laboratories </span>. However, P26 is interfered with by coeluting chlorobornanes in some matrices, and P62 can vary widely in its instrumental response. Furthermore, in North America, most datasets for toxaphene are still based on quantification with technical toxaphene, which yields a single value and no congener-specific information. Capacity for determining toxaphene outside of the USA, Canada and western Europe is very limited judging from the relatively large number of measurements from these countries and the dearth of measurements elsewhere

                <p>
                    The situation for chlordane is better because analytical standards are available for the major components (<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic">cis</span>- and<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic"> trans</span>-chlordane;<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic"> cis</span>- and<span class="EmphasisTypeItalic"> trans</span>-nonachlor, heptachlor). Nevertheless, keith9-11" class="citation"&gt; other octachloro- and nonachlorochlordane components are important and are often found in top predators, and analysts need to be aware of possible interferences from these compounds in seabird and marine mammal extracts.

                    The chlorinated insecticides endosulfan, lindane and methoxychlor are also candidates for inclusion in analytical methods where impacts of OCPs are being investigated. <span id="#CR12-13" class="citation"> Global use of these insecticides, particularly endosulfan, is very significant.</span> These current-use pesticides can generally be isolated and quantified along with other OCPs.

                    In summary, the minimum number of PCB/OCPs to be considered will vary with the objectives of a given study. A long list of analytes would be used for initial surveys where no information was available. Chemical structures and physical and chemical properties of selected PCBs and OCPs are listed in the appendix.

                <p>
                    The availability of accurate analytical standards is a fundamental requirement of an analytical program designed to quantify PCB/OCPs. Standards are available from commercial chemical supply companies as well as from agencies involved in certification of reference materials, e.g., the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or from the Bureau Communautaire de Référence (BCR) via the Sigma-Aldrich company. <span id="#CR15-16" class="citation">Interlaboratory studies have shown that incorrect analytical standards and calibration errors can be a major source of error in POPs analysis </span>. These authors recommended that multilevel calibration at 4–6 levels should be used to define the response profile, that calibration solutions should be checked against independent solutions, either from another reliable laboratory or by preparing duplicate solutions, and that calibrants should be ampouled (in sealed glass vials) for long-term storage. They noted that refrigerator storage can loosen the caps on screw-top vials. Thus, storage of calibrant solutions in this manner should only be temporary.

                    Quantification of PCBs can be carried out using two approaches; by  mixture or individual congener standard. The former method employs a standard that was available as a commercial product (e.g., Aroclor 1254 used in transformer oils) to quantitate the congeners contained in the Aroclor mixture against those matching in the sample. There are several mixtures available, with varying degrees of mean chlorination. <span id="#CR17" class="citation">Percent ratios of the congeners in various commercial mixtures have been reported</span>. The limitation of this method is <span id="#CR18" class="citation">the varying congener ratios within a given commercial mixture due to batch-to-batch production variability which, in turn, may lead to congener calculation error </span>. Also, a significant bias resulting in an overestimation of PCB measurements may occur if the PCB pattern in the sample does not match that of the standards. It has been suggested that <span id="#CR19" class="citation">accurate PCB determinations can be made if the chromatographic pattern of both the standards and the samples are similar</span>. However, if the pattern differs, the study reported a bias doubling the values determined by the individual congener standard. The method of choice is congener determination using standard mixtures comprising composite individual congeners added at known quantities which were purchased individually. This provides an improved and known level of accuracy not possible with the commercial PCB mixture approach.
