            In that study quantitation of minor components may have been unreliable due to single level calibration against high levels of individual congener standards. Two lots of Aroclor 1254 had markedly different congener distributions.
        </p>

        <p class="citing_text">
            PCB congener profiles of 15 Aroclor 1254 mixtures are presented. These profiles show that the less common, high TEQ variety of Aroclor 1254 was manufactured by an atypical, two-stage chlorination process that was apparently used during the final 1% of Aroclor 1254 production (ca. 1974–1976).

            Industrial processes, urban incineration, leaking electrical transformers, hazardous waste accidents, and improper waste disposal practices have released appreciable quantities of PCBs into the environment. This contamination has resulted in the global distribution of these compounds via the atmosphere and their ubiquitous presence in ambient air.

        <p class="citing_text">
            Previous studies have shown how a variety of industrial materials and actions have dispersed trace amounts of PCBs into the atmosphere, accounting for a global trace level which must be accounted for in sample collection.
